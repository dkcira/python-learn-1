# is_prime
# A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. (Boy, that's a mouthful.)

# In other words, if you want to test if a number in a variable x is prime, then no other number should go into x evenly besides 1 and x. So 2 and 5 and 11 are all prime, but 4 and 18 and 21 are not.

# If there is a number between 1 and x that goes in evenly, then x is not prime.

# Instructions
# Define a function called is_prime that takes a number x as input.
# For each number n from 2 to x - 1, test if x is evenly divisible by n.
# If it is, return False.
# If none of them are, then return True.
